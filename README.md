### Zip:

1. Click [here](https://github.com/eliza85/ascii_group_project.git) to go to the repository location where you will find the clone/download menu.

 2. Navigate to the directory (folder) that contains your browser's downloads.
 3. Double-click on **Ascii Land** directory (folder).
 4. Open the directory contents by extracting/unzipping the documents from the folder.
 5. Make sure your system has `Ruby 2.6.5`, `Rails 5.2.4.1` or higher, and `NPM` installed.

##### Mac OS Installation

On OS X with Homebrew, install ImageMagick:

```sh
brew install imagemagick@6
```
 1. If any errors occur here, refer to the **Troubleshooting** section below these instructions.
 2. With your tools installed, and within the folder, run `bundle install`. Make sure all gems install correctly before moving on.
 3. Next, run `rake db:create` and `rake db:migrate`. Make sure all processes complete successfully.
 4. Finally, run `rails s` or `rails server` and navigate to `localhost:3000` to use **Ascii Land**.

##### Windows OS Installation

To install ImageMagick on Windows OS, use the [official link](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows) on ImageMagick's website. Navigate to `ImageMagick 6.9.6-0 Q16 x64 2016-10-02`.  

**The most crucial steps during installation of ImageMagick on Windows is to check the following two options:**
1. **Add application directory to your system path** – otherwise Windows won’t recognize any of the commands and tell you something like ‘convert’ is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.

2. **Install legacy utilities** – the new version of ImageMagick got rid of the old convert and mogrify commands in favor of a single command. Checking this box will allow you to still use the old convert and mogrify commands.

## Troubleshooting

#### Can't install RMagick. Can't find libMagick or one of the dependent libraries. Check the mkmf.log file for more detailed information

Typically this message means that one or more of the libraries that ImageMagick
depends on hasn't been installed. Examine the mkmf.log file in the ext/RMagick
subdirectory of the installation directory for any error messages. These
messages typically contain enough additional information for you to be able to
diagnose the problem. Also see [this FAQ](https://web.archive.org/web/20131206133600/http://rmagick.rubyforge.org/install-faq.html#libmagick).

On OS X with Homebrew, try (re)installing pkg-config:

```sh
brew uninstall pkg-config
brew install pkg-config
brew unlink pkg-config
brew link pkg-config
```
